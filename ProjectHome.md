cvBlob is a library designed specifically for Android, in order to perform blob detection and extraction. The library has been designed based on a single-pass algorithm, detecting first the blobs, and then labeling and optimizing them.

I used as a base the Java algorithm proposed by Dr. Andrew Greensted, although I soon realized that the implementation was not suitable for Android based-phones. With the library there is a sample application provided, so you can check the basics.

If you have any comment about the library, feel free to contact me at eenriquelopez@gmail.com

You can access further information about [labeling tables](http://code.google.com/p/cvblob-for-android/wiki/LabelTable) and [labeling](http://code.google.com/p/cvblob-for-android/wiki/Labeling).

You can download an [APK demo](http://cvblob-for-android.googlecode.com/files/cvBlobDetectionDemo.apk)  or the [full library](http://cvblob-for-android.googlecode.com/files/cvBlobDetection.zip)

Remember that in order to use the library, you have to add to your project as a library. In order to accomplish that, you should add it on the target project, under "Properties -> Android -> Add Library"
